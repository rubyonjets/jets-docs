Jets v5 reduces the number APIGW Resources and Methods deployed by collapsing essentially one APIGW proxy route.

Believe that most apps, IE: More than 80% of apps do not care about APIGW features. Most want a routing engine that is as close to the Rails routing engine as possible. By aiming for this, Jets v5 was able to get around APIGW limitations like the "Sibling Variable Limit" problem.
