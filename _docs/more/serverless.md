Serverless is a bit of misnomer. At the end of the day, there's a server that processes the request. Serverless is more of a marketing term.

That being said, Serverless does mean some things.

* It's a managed server, so all you need things like OS patching, upgrade, etc. You are just responsible for the code.
* It's charge at a lower level of granularity. At the request level, not the server level.
