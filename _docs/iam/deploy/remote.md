This docs cover IAM role and permissions that jets uses to deploy your used by the [CodeBuild Project]({% link _docs/remote/codebuild/iam.md %}), this runs on the **remote** machine.

The `jets deploy` command needs IAM permissions to deploy and create the AWS resources for your project. Here is a table of the services in the default policy in general:

* API Gateway
* CloudFormation
* CloudFront
* CodeBuild
* DynamoDB
* EC2
* ECR
* ECR Public
* Events
* IAM
* Lambda
* Logs
* Route53
* S3
* SNS
* SQS
* STS
* WAF
* WAFv2

**Note**: Jets dynamically adds some of these permissions to the IAM Role only when needed, e.g., EC2 when using [VpcConfig]({% link _docs/config/vpc.md %}). The IAM permissions may change in the future as Jets evolves and we add features. We'll try to update the permissions to this document as best we can but be aware it may be out-of-date. You can also submit a PR to help update this doc.

There are usually tradeoffs in engineering. The Jets default IAM permissions try to find a balance between overly strict permissions that may cause issues and user-friendliness and convenience. It is nearly impossible to please everyone. That being said, you can override the default Jets IAM permissions entirely and remove permissions. See: `codebuild.iam.default_policy` in [Config Bootstrap]({% link _docs/config/bootstrap/codebuild.md %}). Just be aware, that you may incidentally remove a required permission.

## Configuring Remote IAM Permissions

See: [Remote Runner CodeBuild IAM Permissions]({% link _docs/remote/codebuild/iam.md %}).

## AWS Service Control Policies

If you believe you have granted all IAM permissions necessary, but are still getting IAM to deploy-related errors. Your AWS account might have [Service Control Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) attached to the AWS account at the Organization level. You will need to check with your AWS Account Organization Administrator.

If you are the Administrator:

* You can navigate to the **AWS Organizations/AWS Accounts/Organizational structure** section. From there, click on your account and proceed to the **Policies** tab to view the attached Policies.
* You can also click on **Policies** side menu, the **Service Control Policies** link to see Available Policies. Click on each of them and check their **Targets** tab to see if they are attached to your AWS account.
