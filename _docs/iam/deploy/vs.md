There are 2 main IAM policies pertaining to deployment that you'll likely be working with.

1. [Local IAM Policy]({% link _docs/iam/deploy/local.md %}): The IAM Policy that you're probably using locally on your machine.
2. [Remote IAM Policy]({% link _docs/iam/deploy/remote.md %}): The IAM Policy that the [CodeBuild remote runner]({% link _docs/remote/codebuild/iam.md %}) uses.
