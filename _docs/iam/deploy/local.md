The local IAM permissions are what you would need if you are running at `jets deploy` on your local machine. These permissions are not as widely scope as you might imagine because Jets client will create a remote runner for the deployment heavy lifting. The Jets client may need some other permission for some of it's CLI features, IE: `jets logs` needs access to CloudWatch Logs. Here are some of the IAM permissions required.

* CloudFormation
* IAM
* S3
* CloudWatch Logs
* CloudBuild

**Note**: These permissions may change in the future as Jets evolves and adds features.

## Instructions

It is recommended that you create an IAM group and associate it with the IAM users that need access to use `jets deploy`.  Here are starter instructions and a policy that you can tailor for your needs. You can follow either the CLI or Console instructions.

The CI Runner permissions are similar to the local IAM permissions because when the CI process runs it's essentially does what you would do locally, IE: `jets deploy`. For details, see: [Jets CI IAM Permissions]({% link _docs/ci/iam.md %}).
