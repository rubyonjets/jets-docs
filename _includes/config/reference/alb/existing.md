alb.existing.dns_name | nil | Allows Jets to create a managed route53 record that points to the existing ALB DNS Name. By default, Jets infers the ALB dns name using the provided `alb.existing.target_group` setting. However, when the target group is associated with multiple ALBs, Jets cannot infer it and this setting is required. See: [Existing Load Balancer Docs]({% link _docs/routing/alb/existing.md %}).
alb.existing.target_group | nil | The setting allows Jets to add a Lambda Permission that lets the ALB to talk your Jets Controller Lambda Function. This is useful if you ever delete your Jets app and redeploy it.  IE: You don't have to run `jets alb:register` again. It also allows Jets to auto-discover the existing ALB DNS Name to automatically set up route53 record when the `alb.dns` settings are used.
